### ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1.  **Audio Capture**: The system monitors background audio in real-time, using Voice Activity Detection (VAD) to identify human speech.
2.  **AI Analysis**: Machine learning models analyze the captured audio for emotional distress, aggressive tones, and specific keywords related to violence.
3.  **Threat Assessment**: Based on the analysis, the system assesses the threat level (Low, Medium, High).
4.  **Smart Response**:
    * **High Threat**: Automatically sends SOS alerts to pre-defined emergency contacts.
    * **Medium/Low Threat**: Provides resources and guidance through the UI.
5.  **Evidence Collection**: Incidents are recorded and can be securely stored in the user's evidence locker.
